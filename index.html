      <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
     <p>Progressive enhancement is a method of web development that’s focused on accessibility first.  Graceful degradation, which came before it, emphasized creating web pages for users with the most enhanced browsers while those with simpler setups could only have an “ok” experience with web pages since they couldn’t use a lot of the features. Progressive enhancement on the other hand puts content first which means every user is able to access the most important information. After content is properly laid out with HTML, then styling is completed with CSS, with scripting being done last to enhance user experience if they have a capable browser.</p>
<p>This method of creating websites makes the most sense to me, maybe since I’m new to the field, but it’s surprising it hasn’t always been done that way. It’s important because usability is at the core of web development. It’s pointless to have a super fancy website if only a small number of people can use it. In the same vein, when thinking about profitability the audience should be as large as possible and methods like graceful degradation shrink the audience size. Another reason progressive enhancement is important is it provides a good foundation for future technology. Since the content, the core of the site, remains the same there’s no need to start from scratch every time new technologies emerge. Lastly, and most importantly progressive enhancement allows all users to access web pages, it provides inclusion to users with disabilities and who require assistance when using computers. </p>
<p>Progressive enhancement is a way of developing that puts users first while also offering the benefits of reaching a larger audience, speeding up load times, and providing a better overall experience for users. As long as web pages are created with HTML that is clear, concise, and well marked up that’s all the foundation needed to create functional appealing websites.</p>
