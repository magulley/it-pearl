            <p>Nestled in the heart of southern Arizona, Kartchner Caverns State Park is home to one of the world’s most pristine living caves. Hidden for thousands of years, these remarkable caverns remain in a delicate, evolving state, offering visitors a rare glimpse into the underground beauty of nature.</p>
            <p>In November 1974, Gary Tenen and Randy Tufts were exploring the limestone hills at the eastern base of the Whetstone Mountains. They were looking “for a cave no one had ever found” and found it. The two kept the cave a secret until February 1978 when they told the property owners, James and Lois Kartchner, about their awesome discovery.</p>
            <p>Since unprotected caves can be seriously damaged by unregulated use, they knew the cave had to be protected. Tenen and Tufts spent several years looking into the possibility of developing the cave themselves. Some members of the Kartchner family lived in Tucson and were very impressed with the development and operation of Catalina State Park by Arizona State Parks. They decided to approach State Parks to see if the agency was interested in acquiring this outstanding resource.</p>
