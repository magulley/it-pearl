    <h2>White Nose Syndrome Prevention</h2>
    <p>Kartchner Caverns is now following established nationwide protocols to prevent the spread of White Nose Syndrome, a fungal disease that is killing bats.</p>
    <p>We request that if you have been in another cave or mine since 2005, you do not wear or bring any of the same clothes or shoes as on your other cave trips. If you arrive at Kartchner Caverns wearing shoes that have been in another cave, you will be asked to visit a White Nose Syndrome Decontamination Station, where your shoes will be sprayed down with rubbing alcohol to kill the fungus. <strong>Thank you for working with us to protect our bats!</strong></p>
